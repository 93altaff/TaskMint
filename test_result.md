# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

          The endpoint mostly works but does NOT match the spec on the daily limit, and there is a related correctness bug.
          BUG #1 (spec mismatch): server uses limit 20, task description said 5.
          BUG #2 (date roll-over): `reset_daily_limits_if_needed()` did NOT reset `daily_watches_used` — user permanently locked out after first limit-day.

          Re-tested POST /api/tasks/watch with updated spec (daily limit = 20). All 6 assertions PASS:
          * 20 successful POST /api/tasks/watch calls, each returning {"reward": <int 20-50>, "remaining": <int>} (remaining counter present and decrementing 19..0).
          * 21st call same day -> 400 {"detail":"Daily watch limit reached"}.
          * User points & total_earned both incremented by sum of rewards (delta=710 for 20 calls).
          * 20 transactions logged with source="watch" in /api/wallet/transactions.
          * Code path for date roll-over confirmed in /app/backend/server.py line 248: reset_daily_limits_if_needed now includes `"daily_watches_used": 0` in the $set block alongside spins/scratches, and also resets it on the in-memory user dict (line 254). Endpoint is correct per the (now-aligned) spec.

        agent: "testing"
        comment: |
          NOTE: actual endpoint shape differs from review wording (review said POST .../review). Implementation uses PUT /api/admin/campaign-completions/{id} with {status, admin_note} and DELETE /api/admin/campaign-completions/{id} for reset. Tested actual implementation:
          * Admin POST /api/admin/campaigns with reward_points=500 -> 200 returns campaign with id.
          * User POST /api/tasks/campaign/{id} -> 200 returns {link_url}.
          * User POST /api/tasks/campaign/{id}/submit with form_field_1_value/form_field_2_value -> 200, {status:"pending"}.
          * Completion appears in GET /api/admin/campaign-completions as pending.
          * Approve: PUT .../{id} {status:"approved", admin_note:"good"} -> 200, user points increase by exactly campaign.reward_points (delta=500).
          * Reject (2nd user): PUT .../{id} {status:"rejected", admin_note:"low quality"} -> 200, completion stored with status=rejected & note saved, NO points credited.
          * Reset: DELETE .../{id} -> 200 {ok:true}, then user can submit the same campaign again successfully (status=pending).
          Minor spec-naming difference only; functionality is correct.

          All 5 testIDs (qa-telegram, qa-telegram-contact, qa-business, qa-privacy, qa-terms) present.
          "Customer Support" text NOT present anywhere on Profile tab. URLs render as subtitles for the
          first three rows. After admin saved business_contact = "mailto:business@taskmint.com", the
          Contact for Business subtitle on Profile updated to that value.

      Frontend UI verification (mobile viewport 390x844) for the 4 user-visible changes — ALL PASS.
      1) Profile -> Quick Access shows the 5 text rows in correct order with subtitles for the
         first three (Telegram, Telegram contact, Business). "Customer Support" is gone.
      2) /admin/links shows 5 inputs with correct labels including "Contact for Business
         (URL or mailto:)"; saving via PUT /api/admin/links works (200) and the new value is
         reflected on Profile.
      3) After admin rejects a UPI withdrawal with reason "Wrong UPI ID", the user's
         Withdrawal History row renders the red "Reason: Wrong UPI ID" pill.
      4) After admin rejects a campaign completion with reason "Invalid screenshot",
         the user's /offers card shows the "Rejected" status chip and red
         "Reason: Invalid screenshot" line below it.
      Setup notes: created admin (fresh device + /api/auth/admin-login) and a separate device
      user via /api/auth/device, seeded points via /api/admin/users/{id}/adjust-points. To avoid
      the cookie session_token from /api/auth/device overriding the admin's cookie session, all
      API calls used credentials:'omit' and Bearer tokens; in the browser, cookies were cleared
      before switching FE between admin/user views. No console errors observed.
